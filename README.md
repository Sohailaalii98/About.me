Hey there, I'm Sohaila and I'm a technical recruiter on a mission to help companies find their perfect match in the tech talent world! With 2 years of experience in the industry, I've learned a thing or two about finding the right people for the job.

When I'm not scouring the internet for the best tech talent out there, I enjoy mind games, and occasionally try my hand at solving the Rubik's Cube (although I usually end up just peeling the stickers off...).

But when it comes to finding top-notch talent, I'm all business. I'm an expert in sourcing, screening, and interviewing candidates, and I love collaborating with hiring managers to develop hiring strategies that work. And when I'm not hunting down the perfect candidate, I'm constantly learning and staying up-to-date on the latest trends and technologies in the tech world.

So whether you're a company in need of top-tier tech talent, or a job seeker looking for your dream gig, I'm here to help. Let's connect and find your perfect match!
